Sniffing: packet sniffing is the process of monitoring and capturing all data packets passing through a given network using a software application 
            or hardware devices.
Passive sniffing: refers to sniffing through a hub, wherein the traffic is sent to all ports.(outdated approach)
Active sniffing: is used to sniff a switch-based network. Involves injecting address resolution packets(ARP) into the network to flood the switch's 
                  content addressable memory(CAM) table, which keeps track of host-port connections
Active sniffing techniques- MAC flooding, DHCP attacks, DNS poisoning, Switch port stealing,ARP poisoning, spoofing attack.

Attckers run sniffers to convert the host systems NIC to promiscous mode.

Lab1: Perform MAC flooding using macof
            * macof -i [interface] -n [no.of packets to be sent]

lab2: Perform DHCP Starvation attack using yersinia
lab3: Perform ARP Poisoning using arpspoof
            * arpspoof -i [interface] -t [target IP] [router default gateway IP]
            * arpspoof -i [interface] -t [router default gateway IP] [target IP]

lab4: Spoof a mac address using mac changer(linux) 
            * 1) ifconfig eth0 down 
              2) macchanger -a eth0
              3) ifconfig eth0 up
Lab5: Wireshark analysis
