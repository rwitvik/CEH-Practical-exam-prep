SESSION HIJACKING: session hijacking is an attck in which an attacker takes over a valid transmission control protocol(TCP) communication session 
				   between two computers.  

--> this attack can lead to man in the middle attack and DOS attack

SESSION HIJACKING PHASES:
1.Tracking the connection
2.Desynchronizing the connection
3.Injecting the attcker's packet.

TYPES OF SESSION HIJACKING:
1. Passive: In passive attack, attacker hijacks a session but sits back, watches, and records all the trafic in that session
2. Active: in an active attack, an attcker finds an active session and seizes control of it.

SESSION HIJACKING LEVELS:
network-level hijacking in which attacker intercept the packets during the transmission between a clent and the server in a TCP or UDP session.

Application-level hijacking in which attacker gain control over the HTTP'S user session by obtaining the session ID's.

APPLICATION-LEVEL SESSION HIJACKING:
Techniques to acquiring control over a valid user's session..such as 
1. Stealing
2.Guessing
3. Brute forcing

NETWORK-LEVEL HIJACKING:
1. blind hijacking
2. UDP hijacking
3. TCP/IP hijacking
4. RST hijacking
5. Man-in-the-middle
6. IP spoofing

SESSION HIJACKING TOOLS:
1. Hetty
2. bettercap
3. OWASP ZAP

METHODS USED TO DETECT SESSION HIJACKING:
1.Manual Method
2.Automatic Mathod


LAB1: session hijacking using ZAP
Lab2: Intercept HTTP traffic using bettercap
Lab3: intercept HTTP traffic using Hetty
