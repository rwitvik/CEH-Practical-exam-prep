    Lab 1: Capture the password using responder and crack it by john the ripper
            - When a DNS name server request fails, Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution(LLMNR) and Net-BIOS Name Service(NBT-NS) is used by Windows machines as a fallback.
              If the DNS name still remains unresolved, the windows performs an unauthenticated UDP broadcast to the whole network. Any masquerading machine,
              claiming to be the server then sends a response and capture the target's credentials during the authentication process.
    Lab 2: search exploits in exploit db.
    Lab 4: exploit client-side vulnerabilities and establish a VNC session.
            - Using msfconsole create a payload and share it with local host. open multi/handler to acess the session. open shared file in windows machine.
