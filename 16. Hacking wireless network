WIRELESS ENCRYPTION: is a process of protecting a wireless network from attckes who attempt to collect sensitive information by breaching the RF traffic.

TYPES OF WIRELESS ENCRYPTION:
1. WEP(WIRED EQUIVALENT PRIVACY)
2. WPA(WIRE-LESS PROTECTED ACCESS)

WIRELESS THREATS:
1. Access control attacks: aim to penetrate network by evading WLAN access control measures such as MAC filters and WIFI port access control.
2. Integrity attacks: involves changing data during transmission.(data frame injection.)
3. confidentiality attacks: attempts to intercept information
4. Availability attacks
5. Authentication attacks

WIRELESS HACKING METHODOLOGY:
the objective of the wireless hacking methodology is to compromise a wifi network to gain unauathorized access to network resources
1. WIFI discovery- 1. passive footprinting
				   2. active footprinting.

2. GPS mapping.
3. Wireless traffic analysis
4. Sniffing wireless traffic(wireshark), perfotm spectrum analysis(Tool: RF explorer)
5. Launch of wireless attacks: Aircrack-ng suite
6. Wifi encryption cracking
