                        users.
                        * In DOS attack, attackers flood the victim system with non-legitimate service requests or traffic to overload its resources.

DDOS: is a large-scale, coordinated attack on the availability of services on victim's system or network resources, and it is launched 
          indirectly through many compromised computers on the internet.
